Download this folder and unzip it to a desired location. 
Before running the code: modify the config_file and the bash_script.sh so that the file paths are the ones in which you extracted the files.

Then, on the terminal:
cd path/to/this/folder
chmod +x bash_script.sh
./bash_script.sh

this will start the whole code. 

The G.c file contains the G node, while the main.c contains all the other nodes.
The functions.h file provides the functions for the correct functioning of the code.
