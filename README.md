# ARP project 
The goal is to simulate a network of multi-process systems, all identical, each one running on a machine in the
same LAN, connected through sockets, exchanging a data token at a specified and measured speed. 
Each machine contains 4 Posix processes:
- P: 
- S:
- G:
- L:token wave, waiting time
Configuration file: contains in text format the necessary parameters: IP address, reference frequency RF of the
